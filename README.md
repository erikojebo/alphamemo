=========

Memory game for kids learning numbers, the letters of the alphabet or to read.

There is language support for English and Swedish. The language used defaults
to the user language of the browser being used, but can be set manually
through the in-game menu (menu button or swipe left-to-right).

## Building the app

All build tasks are done via grunt, so to build the app you simply run the
default grunt task.

## Running the app locally

After building the app using grunt you can use the files in the dist directory
to run the app.

To run the app locally in Chrome using the straight up static HTML you need to add
the following command line argument to you Chrome shortcut/launcher:

`--allow-file-access-from-files`
